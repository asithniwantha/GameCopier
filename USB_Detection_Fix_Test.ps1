# USB Detection Fix Diagnostic
# Tests the fix for drives not showing in the UI

Write-Host "=== USB DETECTION FIX DIAGNOSTIC ===" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "?? ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "? Problem: Drives were detected but not showing in UI" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "?? Root Cause: LoadDrivesAsync() was calling GetRemovableDrivesAsync() without most recent drive info" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "? Solution: Added CurrentMostRecentDrive property to detection service" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "? Fix: LoadDrivesAsync() now uses GetRemovableDrivesWithHighlightAsync() with proper highlighting" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host ""

Write-Host "?? WHAT THE FIX DOES:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "1. Detection service now exposes CurrentMostRecentDrive property" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "2. LoadDrivesAsync() gets most recent drive info from detection service" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "3. Uses GetRemovableDrivesWithHighlightAsync() for consistent behavior" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "4. Ensures highlighting works during initialization AND real-time updates" -ForegroundColor White

Write-Host "?? TESTING STEPS:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "1. Launch the GameDeploy app ? Should see:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   ? Any existing USB drives appear in the list" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   ? Proper device descriptions shown" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   ? Status shows correct drive count" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "2. Plug in a USB drive ? Should see:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   ? Drive appears within 1 second" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   ? Gets ? highlighting and 'Just Plugged!' text" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   ? Orange 'NEWEST' badge appears in UI" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   ? Status shows 'Most recent: X:' drive letter" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "3. Click 'Manual Refresh' button ? Should see:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   ? List refreshes and drives remain visible" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   ? Most recent drive keeps its highlighting" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   ? No drives disappear unexpectedly" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "4. Use Settings button (??) ? Should see:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   ? Force refresh works correctly" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   ? Drives remain visible after refresh" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host "?? Expected Debug Output:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "During App Launch:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "?? Starting USB-only detection service..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "?? Loading USB drives..." -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "?? Most recent drive from detection service: H (or none)" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "?? === Starting USB-ONLY drive detection with device info ===" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "? Added USB drive: H:\ - Removable - Device Description" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "?? UpdateDriveListDirectly: Processing 1 USB drives ON UI THREAD" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "During USB Plug/Unplug:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "?? USB drives ADDED: H" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "? Most recent USB drive: H" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "? Highlighted most recent USB drive: H" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "?? FORCE UI UPDATE: Got 1 USB drives from service" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host "?? TECHNICAL DETAILS:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "Files Modified:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "• DriveService.cs - Added CurrentMostRecentDrive property" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "• MainViewModel.cs - Updated LoadDrivesAsync() to use highlighting method" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "Key Changes:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "• Detection service exposes its internal _mostRecentDrive state" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "• LoadDrivesAsync() now consistent with real-time updates" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "• Both initialization and live detection use same code path" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "• Highlighting persists across manual refreshes" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host "??  IF DRIVES STILL DON'T SHOW:" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "1. Check if any USB drives are actually plugged in" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "2. Verify drives are detected by Windows (check File Explorer)" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "3. Look for error messages in debug output" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "4. Try plugging/unplugging the USB drive" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "5. Check if drives are DriveType.Removable (not Fixed)" -ForegroundColor White

Write-Host "? EXPECTED RESULT:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "USB drives should now appear in the UI consistently!" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Both initial load and real-time detection should work." -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "Most recent drive highlighting should persist across refreshes." -ForegroundColor Green
