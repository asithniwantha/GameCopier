# GameCopier - Future Improvements & Roadmap

## 📋 Overview
This document outlines planned improvements and enhancements for the GameCopier application to address current limitations and add advanced features.

---

## 🚀 High Priority Improvements

### 1. **Parallel Multi-Drive Copy Operations**
**Current Limitation:** Copy operations are sequential - must finish one operation before starting another.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Implement true parallel copying to different USB drives simultaneously
- Add intelligent drive detection to determine optimal parallelism
- Create drive-specific copy queues with independent progress tracking

**Technical Implementation:**
```csharp
// New Architecture Components:
- ParallelCopyManager.cs - Manages multiple concurrent copy operations
- DriveSpecificQueue.cs - Individual queues per drive
- ConcurrentProgressTracker.cs - Tracks progress across multiple operations
- ResourceManager.cs - Manages system resources (CPU, I/O bandwidth)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Dramatically reduced total copy time when using multiple drives
- ✅ Better resource utilization
- ✅ Improved user experience with true multitasking

---

### 2. **Real-Time Queue Management**
**Current Limitation:** Cannot add items to queue while copy operations are in progress.

**Proposed Solution:**
- Implement dynamic queue that accepts new items during active operations
- Add queue priority system (High, Normal, Low)
- Enable queue reordering via drag-and-drop interface

**Technical Implementation:**
```csharp
// Enhanced Queue System:
- DynamicDeploymentQueue.cs - Thread-safe queue with real-time additions
- QueuePriorityManager.cs - Handles priority-based ordering
- QueueStateManager.cs - Manages queue state during operations
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No need to wait for current operations to complete
- ✅ Better workflow efficiency
- ✅ Enhanced user control over copy operations
