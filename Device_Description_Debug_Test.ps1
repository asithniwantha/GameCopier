Write-Host "?? SPECIFIC DEBUG ITEMS TO CHECK:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "A. BRAND/MODEL EXTRACTION:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   • Does it find the brand in the device description?" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   • Are the brand and model being set correctly?" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   • Is the cleaning process removing too much text?" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "B. ENHANCED DESCRIPTION LOGIC:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   • Which parts are being added (brand, model, filesystem)?" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   • Is it falling back to device description?" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   • What's the final result string?" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "C. UI BINDING:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   • Is the EnhancedDescription property being called?" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "   • Are there any binding errors in the debug output?" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host "?? IF STILL NOT WORKING:" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "1. Share the debug output starting with:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   '?? Getting enhanced device description for [drive]'" -ForegroundColor Cyan

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "2. Look for any error messages (?) in the debug output" -ForegroundColor White

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "3. Check if the EnhancedDescription debug messages appear" -ForegroundColor White

Write-Host "?? KEY IMPROVEMENTS:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "? Detailed logging at every step of description creation" -ForegroundColor Green
