## Security Best Practices for Users

### Safe Usage Guidelines

1. **Download from Official Sources**
   - Only download GameCopier from official GitHub releases
   - Verify file hashes when provided
   - Be cautious of unofficial distributions

2. **System Security**
   - Keep your Windows system updated
   - Use antivirus software with real-time protection
   - Run GameCopier with standard user privileges when possible

3. **Game Library Security**
   - Only add trusted game directories to your library
   - Be cautious when deploying games from unknown sources
   - Regularly scan your game files for malware

4. **USB Drive Safety**
   - Scan USB drives before use
   - Use reputable drive brands and vendors
   - Safely eject drives after deployment

### Permission Requirements

GameCopier requires the following permissions:

- **File System Access**: To read game directories and write to USB drives
- **WMI Queries**: To gather detailed drive information
- **Network Access**: For future cloud features (optional)

These permissions are used solely for the application's intended functionality.

## Known Security Considerations

### File System Operations
- **Large File Handling**: Exercise caution with very large game files
- **Drive Space**: Ensure adequate space before deployment to prevent system issues
- **Path Lengths**: Windows path length limitations may affect some games

### WMI Queries
- **System Information**: The application queries system information for drive details
- **Privacy**: No personal information is collected or transmitted
- **Permissions**: Standard user permissions are sufficient for most operations

### Network Features (Future)
- **Encrypted Connections**: All network communications will use encryption
- **Authentication**: Secure authentication mechanisms for cloud features
- **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data will be transmitted

## Security Measures in Place

### Code Security
- **Input Validation**: All user inputs are validated and sanitized
- **Error Handling**: Errors are handled gracefully without exposing sensitive information
- **Dependency Management**: Regular updates to third-party dependencies
- **Static Analysis**: Automated code analysis for security vulnerabilities

### Build Security
- **Signed Binaries**: Release binaries are digitally signed
- **Reproducible Builds**: Build process is documented and reproducible
- **Automated Testing**: Security tests are included in the CI/CD pipeline
- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated scanning for vulnerable dependencies

### Distribution Security
- **GitHub Releases**: Official releases are distributed through GitHub
- **Checksums**: File hashes are provided for verification
- **Release Notes**: Security fixes are documented in release notes
- **Version Control**: All changes are tracked in version control
