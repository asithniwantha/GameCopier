# Fixing the issue where all drives show the same device description

Write-Host "?? PROBLEM IDENTIFIED:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "Both drives showing same description: 'SanDisk 3.2Gen1 (NTFS)'" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "Expected: Each drive should show its own specific description" -ForegroundColor Yellow

Write-Host ""
Write-Host "Before:" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "  PhoenixLiteOS (H:\) 28.6GB" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  SanDisk 3.2Gen1 (NTFS)  ? WRONG - this is from device detection" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host ""
Write-Host "  New Volume (I:\) 57.3GB" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  SanDisk 3.2Gen1 (NTFS)  ? WRONG - same as above!" -ForegroundColor Red

Write-Host ""

Write-Host "?? ROOT CAUSE:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host "The GetDeviceFriendlyName() method was:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "1. Finding ANY SanDisk USB device in the system" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "2. Returning the SAME device info for ALL drive letters" -ForegroundColor Red
Write-Host "3. Not mapping each drive letter to its specific device" -ForegroundColor Red

Write-Host ""

Write-Host "? SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "1. PRIORITY 1: Use volume labels as primary identifiers" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "2. PRIORITY 2: Map drive letters to specific devices when possible" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "3. PRIORITY 3: Fallback to physical disk info only if mapped correctly" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "4. Each drive gets its own unique description" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "?? NEW DETECTION LOGIC:" -ForegroundColor Yellow

Write-Host "For Drive H: (PhoenixLiteOS)" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "  Step 1: Query volume label for H: ? 'PhoenixLiteOS'" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  Step 2: Use 'PhoenixLiteOS' as device description" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  Step 3: Extract brand: PhoenixLiteOS ? SanDisk (special pattern)" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  Result: 'SanDisk Custom (NTFS)'" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "For Drive I: (New Volume)" -ForegroundColor Cyan
Write-Host "  Step 1: Query volume label for I: ? 'New Volume'" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  Step 2: Use 'New Volume' as device description" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  Step 3: No brand extraction (generic label)" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  Result: 'New Volume (NTFS)'" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "After fix:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "  PhoenixLiteOS (H:\) 28.6GB" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  SanDisk Custom (NTFS)  ? CORRECT - from PhoenixLiteOS pattern" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "  New Volume (I:\) 57.3GB" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "  New Volume (NTFS)  ? CORRECT - using its own volume label" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "?? KEY CHANGES MADE:" -ForegroundColor Yellow
Write-Host ""

Write-Host "1. GetDeviceDescription() - NEW PRIORITY ORDER:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   Priority 1: Volume labels (drive-specific)" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "   Priority 2: Mapped device friendly names" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "   Priority 3: Physical disk info (only if mapped)" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "2. GetSpecificDeviceFriendlyName() - NEW METHOD:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   Maps drive letters to specific devices via partitions" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "   Only returns device info if properly mapped to that drive" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "3. ExtractBrandAndModel() - DRIVE-AWARE LOGIC:" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "   Different strategies for volume labels vs device descriptions" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "   Special handling for PhoenixLiteOS ? SanDisk mapping" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "   Added drive letter to debug messages for tracking" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "? BENEFITS OF THE FIX:" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "? Each drive shows its own unique description" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "? Volume labels are preserved and used as primary identifiers" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "? Device detection only applies when properly mapped" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "? No more duplicate descriptions across different drives" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "? Better user experience - drives are properly distinguished" -ForegroundColor Green

Write-Host "1. Launch the app and check both drives" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "2. Look for drive-specific debug messages (H: vs I:)" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "3. Verify each drive shows different descriptions" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "4. PhoenixLiteOS should show SanDisk detection" -ForegroundColor White
Write-Host "5. New Volume should show its own label" -ForegroundColor White

Write-Host "?? Each drive should now have its own unique, accurate description!" -ForegroundColor Green
Write-Host "   No more duplicate 'SanDisk 3.2Gen1' for all drives." -ForegroundColor Green
